Project Overview
The RBAC UI is a web-based application that allows administrators to manage users, roles, and permissions in a system. It provides a graphical interface for controlling access to different parts of the application based on users' roles. The core components of the system include:

User Management - View, add, edit, and delete users, and assign roles.
Role Management - Create, edit, and delete roles, and assign permissions to them.
Dynamic Permissions - Assign and modify permissions for roles in real-time.
This system is designed to ensure that users have access to only the parts of the system that they are authorized to use, enhancing security and simplifying user management.

Features
1. User Management:
View Users: List all users in the system with their assigned roles and statuses.
Add Users: Create new users and assign roles.
Edit Users: Modify user details and change their assigned roles.
Delete Users: Remove users from the system.
Assign Roles: Assign and manage roles for users.

3. Role Management:
Create Roles: Define new roles with specific permissions.
Edit Roles: Modify existing roles and update their associated permissions.
Delete Roles: Remove roles from the system.
Assign Permissions: Define the permissions each role should have (e.g., Read, Write, Delete).

5. Dynamic Permissions:
Assign Permissions to Roles: Enable roles to have different levels of access, such as Read, Write, or Delete, and manage these permissions dynamically.
Modify Permissions: Admins can change permissions for roles at any time to control access to resources.

7. Custom API Simulation (Optional):
Mocked API calls simulate CRUD operations on users and roles.
Simulate server responses to validate functionality.
